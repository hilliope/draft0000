I do not know when I started to think this way: mine or your individuality summed up in dreams we create and embody.
A dream is not only a metaphysical experience. Dreams are living things that grow, change, respond to stimuli. 
Most cruelly, they develop homeostasis and learn to reproduce.
If this truth were a truth I was meant to behold, there must be a personal sacrifice. 
We seem either designed or indoctrinated into a lifetime where we create images and stories for our lives that do not exist.
The barriers between dreams and delusions are not to be talked about, doing so would be terrible gauche and ruin the potential intriegue of the future (dream).
I am now so splayed across a lifetime of dreaming, 
so overflowing with new and old ones and out of sync with the natural season of dreaming that 
my most precious parts feel like the scrapes of cake leftover after cutting the edges off to ice it in a smooth, edgeless cylinder.
